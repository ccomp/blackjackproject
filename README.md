Blackjack Questions
================

1. The program is unable to run as a result of some syntax errors. I have not been able to reference my button panel class to the main class, and other methods remain inaccessible.
2. The single best feature of my program is the buttonPanel class, in which I properly make use of Action Listeners. This is different from other students as I add the betting function into this class.
3. Multiple classes can be used in order to make complex object code/multiple objects.
4. A private variable can only be referenced by the class in which it is found. A public variable can be referenced by any class in the directory. This holds true for public and private methods as well.
5. One creates objects and methods using classes. An instance is used to control the aforementioned.
6. Inheritance code is used in order to import methods from other classes. It is beneficial because one does not need to rewrite his/her code as a result
7. The keyword 'this' references the method it is stored in. 'Super' references the parent class.
8. The two properties of all objects are state and behavior.
9. I am still confused by inheritance classes.
